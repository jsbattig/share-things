# Implementation Next Steps

## Overview

This document outlines the next steps for implementing the auto hostname detection feature in the ShareThings application.

## Code Mode Implementation

After reviewing and approving the detailed plans, we'll switch to Code mode to implement the solution. The implementation will follow the phased approach outlined in the summary document:

### Phase 1: Client-Side Implementation

1. Modify SocketContext.tsx:
   - Update the `getBackendUrl()` function to prioritize auto-detection
   - Add support for different port scenarios
   - Add better logging

2. Update client/.env.example:
   - Add VITE_API_PORT environment variable
   - Update documentation for auto-detection

### Phase 2: Setup Script Implementation

1. Update setup.sh:
   - Make the hostname prompt optional
   - Update environment variable configuration
   - Add comments explaining the auto-detection feature

### Phase 3: Server-Side Implementation

1. Update server CORS configuration:
   - Modify to handle wildcard origins
   - Add support for dynamic origin determination

### Phase 4: Testing

1. Run unit tests
2. Run integration tests
3. Run the build-and-test.sh script
4. Run the build-production.sh script
5. Manually verify the application works in different scenarios

## Code Mode Workflow

In Code mode, we'll follow this workflow:

1. Read the current file to understand its structure
2. Make the necessary changes
3. Test the changes
4. Move on to the next file

## Files to Modify

1. client/src/contexts/SocketContext.tsx
2. client/.env.example
3. setup.sh
4. server/src/server.ts (or wherever the CORS configuration is located)

## Testing Approach

1. After each file modification, we'll run appropriate tests
2. After all modifications are complete, we'll run the build-and-test.sh script
3. Finally, we'll run the build-production.sh script

## Documentation Updates

1. Update README.md to explain the auto-detection feature
2. Update DOCKER.md to explain the auto-detection feature
3. Add comments in the code to explain the auto-detection logic

## Switching to Code Mode

To implement these changes, we'll switch to Code mode using the switch_mode tool:

```
<switch_mode>
<mode_slug>code</mode_slug>
<reason>Need to implement the auto hostname detection feature as outlined in the detailed plans</reason>
</switch_mode>
```

## Conclusion

By following this implementation plan, we'll be able to add automatic hostname detection to the ShareThings application while keeping manual hostname configuration as an optional override. This will simplify the setup process for users while maintaining flexibility for specific use cases.
