# CI/CD Pipeline Update

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to the ShareThings CI/CD pipeline to improve efficiency and reduce redundancy.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed the Build Production Step

We've removed the `build-production` job from the CI/CD pipeline for the following reasons:

- **Redundancy**: The `test-setup` job already performs comprehensive testing of the application in a production-like environment, including installation, updates, reinstallation, and custom port configuration.
- **Efficiency**: Removing this step reduces the overall execution time of the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Simplification**: The pipeline is now more straightforward with fewer potential points of failure.

### 2. Updated Dependencies

- Modified the `deploy-production` job to depend on `test-setup` and `integration` jobs instead of `build-production`.
- This ensures that all necessary verification steps are still completed before deployment.

### 3. Documentation Updates

- Updated README.md to remove the Build Production badge and add a Test Setup badge.
- Updated the CI/CD section in README.md to reflect the new pipeline structure.

## Rationale

The `test-setup.sh` script already performs a comprehensive set of tests that verify the application can be built and run correctly in a production environment:

1. **Fresh installation**: Tests that the application can be installed from scratch.
2. **Update installation**: Tests that the application can be updated.
3. **Reinstall**: Tests that the application can be reinstalled.
4. **Custom port configuration**: Tests that the application works with custom port settings.
5. **Container verification**: Verifies that containers are running correctly after each operation.

These tests provide sufficient coverage to ensure the application is production-ready, making the separate `build-production` step unnecessary.

## Benefits

1. **Faster CI/CD Pipeline**: Removing a redundant step reduces the overall execution time.
2. **Simplified Maintenance**: Fewer steps mean less maintenance overhead.
3. **Clearer Pipeline Structure**: The pipeline now has a more logical flow from testing to deployment.

## Artifacts

The build artifacts (server/dist and client/dist) needed for deployment are still being uploaded by the `build` job, ensuring they're available for the deployment process.
