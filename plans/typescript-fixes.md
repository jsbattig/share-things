# TypeScript Fixes for ShareThings

This document outlines the TypeScript errors that were encountered during the Docker build process and the fixes that were applied to resolve them.

## Overview

When building the ShareThings application with Docker, two TypeScript errors were encountered:

1. In `client/src/contexts/ContentStoreContext.tsx`: Variable scope issue with `updatedContent`
2. In `client/src/utils/chunking.ts`: Missing parameter in `encryptData` function call

These errors prevented the Docker build from completing successfully. The following sections detail each error and the fix that was applied.

## Error 1: Variable Scope Issue in ContentStoreContext.tsx

### Error Message

```
src/contexts/ContentStoreContext.tsx(735,61): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'updatedContent'.
```

### Issue Description

The variable `updatedContent` was defined inside a state update function (using React's `setContents` with a callback function), but it was being referenced outside of that function's scope. This caused a TypeScript error because the variable was not accessible in the outer scope.

### Code Before Fix

```typescript
setContents(prevContents => {
  // Create a new map from the previous contents
  const newContents = new Map(prevContents);
  
  // Create a properly typed ContentEntry
  const updatedContent: ContentEntry = {
    metadata: {
      // ... metadata properties ...
    },
    data: reassembledBlob,
    isComplete: true,
    lastAccessed: new Date()
  };
  
  // Update just this specific content entry while preserving all others
  newContents.set(contentId, updatedContent);
  
  // Log the content IDs in the new map before returning
  console.log(`[decryptAndReassemble] New content count: ${newContents.size}`);
  console.log(`[decryptAndReassemble] Content IDs in new map:`, Array.from(newContents.keys()));
  
  return newContents;
});

console.log(`[decryptAndReassemble] Content updated with Blob data, isComplete set to true`);
console.log(`[decryptAndReassemble] Image info:`, updatedContent.metadata.metadata.imageInfo);
```

### Fix Applied

The fix was to use the current state (`contents`) to access the updated content instead of trying to use the variable from the inner scope:

```typescript
setContents(prevContents => {
  // Create a new map from the previous contents
  const newContents = new Map(prevContents);
  
  // Create a properly typed ContentEntry
  const updatedContent: ContentEntry = {
    metadata: {
      // ... metadata properties ...
    },
    data: reassembledBlob,
    isComplete: true,
    lastAccessed: new Date()
  };
  
  // Update just this specific content entry while preserving all others
  newContents.set(contentId, updatedContent);
  
  // Log the content IDs in the new map before returning
  console.log(`[decryptAndReassemble] New content count: ${newContents.size}`);
  console.log(`[decryptAndReassemble] Content IDs in new map:`, Array.from(newContents.keys()));
  
  // Store a reference to the updated content for logging outside this function
  const contentForLogging = updatedContent;
  
  return newContents;
});

console.log(`[decryptAndReassemble] Content updated with Blob data, isComplete set to true`);
// Use the content from the latest state instead of the variable from inside the state updater function
console.log(`[decryptAndReassemble] Image info:`, contents.get(contentId)?.metadata.metadata.imageInfo);
```

### Explanation

The fix uses `contents.get(contentId)` to access the updated content from the current state, which is the correct way to access state after an update. This ensures that we're working with the latest state and avoids the variable scope issue.

## Error 2: Missing Parameter in chunking.ts

### Error Message

```
src/utils/chunking.ts(82,41): error TS2554: Expected 3 arguments, but got 2.
```

### Issue Description

The `encryptData` function in `encryption.ts` expects 3 arguments: `key`, `data`, and `passphrase`. However, in `chunking.ts`, it was being called with only 2 arguments: `key` and `chunkData`. This caused a TypeScript error because the function was not being called with the correct number of arguments.

### Code Before Fix

```typescript
// Encrypt chunk
const { encryptedData, iv } = await encryptData(key, chunkData);
```

### Fix Applied

The fix was to add the missing `passphrase` parameter to the function call:

```typescript
// Encrypt chunk
const { encryptedData, iv } = await encryptData(key, chunkData, passphrase);
```

### Explanation

The `encryptData` function in `encryption.ts` is defined as:

```typescript
export async function encryptData(
  key: CryptoKey,
  data: ArrayBuffer | Uint8Array,
  passphrase: string
): Promise<{ encryptedData: ArrayBuffer; iv: Uint8Array }> {
  // Function implementation...
}
```

It requires the `passphrase` parameter to generate a deterministic IV (Initialization Vector) for the encryption. By adding the missing parameter, we ensure that the function has all the information it needs to encrypt the data correctly.

## Conclusion

These TypeScript fixes resolved the build errors that were preventing the Docker build from completing successfully. The fixes ensure that:

1. Variables are accessed from the correct scope
2. Functions are called with the correct number of arguments

These types of errors are common in TypeScript development and can be caught by the TypeScript compiler before they cause runtime issues. By fixing these errors, we've improved the reliability and correctness of the ShareThings application.

## Recommendations

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Use TypeScript Linting**: Configure ESLint with TypeScript rules to catch these issues during development
2. **Run TypeScript Checks Before Committing**: Add a pre-commit hook to run `tsc --noEmit` to check for TypeScript errors
3. **Add Type Tests**: Write tests that specifically verify type correctness
4. **Document Function Parameters**: Ensure that function parameters are well-documented, especially when they're required

By following these recommendations, you can catch and fix TypeScript errors early in the development process, before they cause build failures or runtime issues.
