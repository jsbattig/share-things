# Git Pull Fix for Production Deployment

## Problem

The GitHub Actions production deployment was failing because:

1. The `git pull` command on the production server was failing due to uncommitted local changes
2. This prevented the repository from being updated with our new networking standardization changes
3. As a result, the `build/config/` directory was missing or outdated on the production server
4. The deployment script continued despite the git pull failure, but couldn't find the necessary configuration files

## Solution

We've modified the `pull_latest_code` function in `setup/config.sh` to handle local changes on the production server:

```bash
pull_latest_code() {
    if [ -d .git ]; then
        log_info "Pulling latest code from git repository..."
        
        # Check for local changes
        if git status --porcelain | grep -q .; then
            log_warning "Local changes detected. Resetting to match remote..."
            git fetch origin
            git reset --hard origin/master  # Adjust branch name if needed
            RESET_EXIT_CODE=$?
            
            if [ $RESET_EXIT_CODE -ne 0 ]; then
                log_error "Failed to reset local changes. Manual intervention required."
                log_warning "Continuing with update anyway in autonomous mode..."
            else
                log_info "Local repository reset to match remote."
            fi
        fi
        
        # Pull latest code
        git pull
        GIT_EXIT_CODE=$?
        
        if [ $GIT_EXIT_CODE -ne 0 ]; then
            log_error "Failed to pull latest code even after reset. Manual intervention required."
            log_warning "Continuing with update anyway in autonomous mode..."
        else
            log_success "Latest code pulled successfully."
        fi
    else
        log_warning "Not a git repository. Skipping code update."
        log_warning "Continuing with container rebuild in autonomous mode..."
    fi
}
```

## How It Works

1. The function first checks if there are any local changes using `git status --porcelain`
2. If local changes are detected, it:
   - Fetches the latest code from the remote repository
   - Resets the local repository to match the remote using `git reset --hard origin/master`
   - Logs the result of the reset operation
3. After handling any local changes, it proceeds with `git pull` to ensure the repository is up to date
4. If the pull fails even after resetting, it logs an error but continues with the update process

## Benefits

1. **Automated Recovery**: The script now automatically handles local changes that would prevent updates
2. **Consistent State**: Ensures the production server always has the latest code from the repository
3. **Reliable Deployments**: Prevents deployment failures due to missing configuration files
4. **Minimal Intervention**: Reduces the need for manual intervention on the production server

## Implementation Notes

- The function uses `git reset --hard` which discards all local changes. This is appropriate for a production server where local changes should not be made directly.
- The branch name is hardcoded as `master`. If your repository uses a different main branch (e.g., `main`), you should adjust this accordingly.
- The function continues with the update process even if the git operations fail, but logs appropriate warnings to alert administrators.

## Testing

This change should be tested in a staging environment before being deployed to production to ensure it correctly handles various git repository states.
