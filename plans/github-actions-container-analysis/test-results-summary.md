# Test Results Summary: Installation and Update Sequence

## Test Execution

I ran the following test sequence:

1. `setup-test-install.sh --skip-cleanup`: Successfully installed the application and left containers running
2. `setup-test-update.sh`: Successfully updated the application and verified the changes

## Key Observations

### Installation Process (setup-test-install.sh)

- The installation process completed successfully
- Containers were built and started properly
- Health checks passed for both frontend and backend containers
- The containers remained running after installation (due to --skip-cleanup flag)

### Update Process (setup-test-update.sh)

- The update process detected the running containers from the previous test
- It successfully modified the health endpoint in the server code
- During the update process:
  - It stopped the existing containers
  - It tried to use `build/config/podman-compose.update.yml` but the file wasn't found
  - It fell back to building and starting containers directly using podman commands
  - The health endpoint was successfully updated and verified
  - The original health endpoint was restored
  - Containers were cleaned up properly

## Identified Issues

1. **Missing podman-compose.update.yml File**:
   ```
   FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './build/config/podman-compose.update.yml'
   ```
   This error occurred during the update process when trying to start containers with podman-compose.

2. **Fallback Mechanism Working**: Despite the missing file, the update process was able to continue by falling back to direct podman commands to build and start containers.

## Conclusion

The test sequence was successful overall, with both installation and update processes completing and verifying the expected changes. The issue with the missing `podman-compose.update.yml` file didn't prevent the update from completing, as the script had a fallback mechanism to build and start containers directly.

This suggests that the issue in GitHub Actions might be related to:

1. The fallback mechanism not working properly in the GitHub Actions environment
2. Differences in how files are created or accessed in the GitHub Actions environment
3. Permissions or security constraints in the GitHub Actions environment

## Next Steps

Based on these test results, I recommend:

1. **Investigate the podman-compose.update.yml File**: Understand why this file is missing during the update process and ensure it's properly created.

2. **Enhance Error Handling**: Improve error handling in the update process to better handle missing files and provide more detailed error messages.

3. **Standardize Container Management**: Consider standardizing on either podman-compose or direct podman commands to avoid the complexity of having both approaches.

4. **Remove Read-Only Flags**: As previously identified, remove the `:ro` flags from volume mounts in the podman-compose files to allow containers to write to these directories if needed.

These changes should help ensure consistent behavior between local development and CI environments.
