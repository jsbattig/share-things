# SQLite Data Persistence Solution

## Problem Summary

The containers in GitHub Actions were failing with permission errors:

1. Backend container: `Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/app/data'`
2. Frontend container: `/app/docker-entrypoint.sh: line 9: can't create /app/public/health/index.json: Permission denied`

These errors occurred because:
- Containers run as non-root user (1001:1001)
- The container user didn't have write permissions to create directories in `/app`
- No persistent volume was configured for SQLite data

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a comprehensive solution to ensure SQLite data persistence between container restarts while addressing permission issues:

### 1. Named Volume for Data Persistence

Added a named volume in `podman-compose.test.ci.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  data_volume:  # Named volume for SQLite data persistence

services:
  backend:
    # ... other configuration ...
    volumes:
      - data_volume:/app/data:Z  # Mount with SELinux context
```

The `:Z` suffix ensures proper SELinux context labeling, which is crucial in containerized environments.

### 2. Directory Creation with Proper Permissions

Updated `server/Dockerfile` to create the data directory with proper ownership:

```dockerfile
# Create data directory with proper permissions for non-root user
RUN mkdir -p /app/data && chown -R 1001:1001 /app/data && chmod -R 755 /app/data
```

### 3. Frontend Container Permissions

Updated `client/Dockerfile` to set proper permissions for the public directory:

```dockerfile
# Create health check directory with proper permissions for non-root user
RUN mkdir -p /app/public/health && \
    echo '{"status":"ok"}' > /app/public/health/index.json && \
    chown -R 1001:1001 /app/public && \
    chmod -R 755 /app/public
```

### 4. Robust Error Handling in Entrypoint Script

Enhanced `client/docker-entrypoint.sh` with better error handling:

```bash
# Create necessary directories with proper error handling
if [ ! -d "/app/public/health" ]; then
  mkdir -p /app/public/health || {
    echo "WARNING: Could not create health directory, it may already exist or permissions issue"
  }
fi

# Try to write health check file with error handling
echo '{"status":"ok"}' > /app/public/health/index.json || {
  echo "WARNING: Could not write health check file, using fallback method"
  # Fallback: check if directory exists but isn't writable
  if [ -d "/app/public/health" ] && [ ! -w "/app/public/health" ]; then
    echo "WARNING: Health directory exists but is not writable. Attempting to fix permissions."
    chmod -R 755 /app/public/health 2>/dev/null || true
  fi
}
```

### 5. GitHub Actions Environment Preparation

Updated `.github/workflows/share-things-ci-cd.yml` to prepare the environment:

```yaml
- name: Prepare environment for containers
  run: |
    # Create necessary directories
    mkdir -p data
    mkdir -p client/dist
    mkdir -p client/dist/health
    
    # Create health check endpoint for frontend
    echo '{"status":"ok"}' > client/dist/health/index.json
    
    # Set appropriate permissions - make directories writable by container user (1001:1001)
    chmod -R 777 data
    chmod -R 777 client/dist
    
    # Create a volume for SQLite data persistence
    podman volume create data_volume || echo "Volume may already exist"
```

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **Data Persistence**: SQLite data persists between container restarts using named volumes
2. **Permission Handling**: Proper permissions for non-root container user (1001:1001)
3. **SELinux Compatibility**: `:Z` suffix ensures proper SELinux context labeling
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if permission issues occur
5. **Environment Consistency**: Works in both local development and CI environments

## Testing

This solution should be tested by:

1. Running the containers in GitHub Actions
2. Verifying that the containers start successfully
3. Checking that SQLite data persists between container restarts
4. Confirming that no permission errors occur in the logs
