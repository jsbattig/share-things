# Container Logs Directory Naming Issue

## Problem Overview

During our investigation, we discovered an issue with how container log directories are being named. In the root of the project, there are directories with names like:

```
container-logs-++ date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S
20250519-000111
```

This indicates a problem with command substitution in shell scripts, which could potentially affect container behavior in GitHub Actions.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Expected Behavior

In `setup/containers.sh`, the code for creating container log directories uses proper command substitution:

```bash
CONTAINER_LOG_DIR="container-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$CONTAINER_LOG_DIR"
```

This should create a directory with a name like `container-logs-20250520-120842`.

### Actual Behavior

In the test logs, we see that the command substitution is not being properly evaluated:

```
+ CONTAINER_LOG_DIR='container-logs-++ date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S
20250519-000111'
+ mkdir -p 'container-logs-++ date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S
20250519-000111'
```

Instead of evaluating `$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)` to get the current date and time, it's treating it as a literal string, which results in directory names with `++ date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S` followed by a newline and then the actual date.

### Inconsistent Behavior

Interestingly, in `setup-debug.log`, we see the correct behavior:

```
++ date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S
+ CONTAINER_LOG_DIR=container-logs-20250519-232954
```

This suggests that the issue is environment-specific and might be related to how the scripts are being executed or logged in different environments.

## Impact on Container Behavior

This issue could potentially affect container behavior in GitHub Actions in several ways:

1. **Path Resolution Issues**: If scripts are trying to access files in these malformed directory paths, they might fail because the paths contain newlines or other special characters.

2. **File Operations**: Operations like copying, moving, or deleting files in these directories might fail due to the malformed paths.

3. **Log Analysis**: It would be difficult to analyze logs stored in these directories because the directory names are inconsistent and contain special characters.

4. **Script Execution**: If other scripts depend on these directory names being properly formatted, they might fail when they encounter the malformed names.

## Recommended Solution

To fix this issue, we recommend:

1. **Use a More Robust Command Substitution**: Instead of using `$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)`, consider using a more explicit approach:

```bash
# Get the date in a separate step
CURRENT_DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
# Use the variable to create the directory name
CONTAINER_LOG_DIR="container-logs-${CURRENT_DATE}"
```

2. **Add Error Handling**: Add error handling to detect and report when command substitution fails:

```bash
CURRENT_DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
if [[ ! $CURRENT_DATE =~ ^[0-9]{8}-[0-9]{6}$ ]]; then
  echo "Error: Failed to get properly formatted date. Using fallback."
  CURRENT_DATE="fallback-$(date +%s)"  # Use Unix timestamp as fallback
fi
CONTAINER_LOG_DIR="container-logs-${CURRENT_DATE}"
```

3. **Standardize Shell Environments**: Ensure that all scripts are executed with the same shell and environment settings to avoid inconsistent behavior.

4. **Add Debugging**: Add more debugging output to help diagnose issues:

```bash
echo "Debug: date command output: $(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
echo "Debug: CONTAINER_LOG_DIR value: $CONTAINER_LOG_DIR"
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Modify `setup/containers.sh` to use the more robust command substitution approach.
2. Add error handling to detect and report when command substitution fails.
3. Add debugging output to help diagnose issues.
4. Test the changes in both local and GitHub Actions environments.

By addressing this issue, we can ensure that container log directories are properly named and accessible, which should help prevent container crashes in GitHub Actions.
