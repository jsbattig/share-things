# Verifying Client/Dist Directory Contents

This document provides a detailed approach for checking that the `client/dist` directory exists and contains the necessary content before starting containers in the GitHub Actions environment.

## Approach Overview

To properly verify the `client/dist` directory:

1. Check if the directory exists
2. Verify it contains the expected files
3. Check file permissions
4. Ensure the directory is accessible to the container

## Implementation in setup-test-install.sh

Add the following code to the `test/setup/setup-test-install.sh` script after the section where directories are created (around line 169-172):

```bash
# Verify client/dist directory and contents
log_info "Step 1.5: Verifying client/dist directory and contents"

# Check if directory exists
if [ ! -d "client/dist" ]; then
  log_warning "client/dist directory does not exist"
  mkdir -p client/dist
  log_info "Created client/dist directory"
else
  log_info "client/dist directory exists"
fi

# Check for essential files
log_info "Checking for essential files in client/dist"
MISSING_FILES=false

# Check for index.html
if [ ! -f "client/dist/index.html" ]; then
  log_warning "index.html is missing from client/dist"
  MISSING_FILES=true
fi

# Check for assets directory (common in built frontend projects)
if [ ! -d "client/dist/assets" ]; then
  log_warning "assets directory is missing from client/dist"
  MISSING_FILES=true
fi

# If files are missing, we need to build the frontend
if [ "$MISSING_FILES" = "true" ]; then
  log_warning "Essential files are missing from client/dist"
  
  # Option 1: Build the frontend (if possible in CI)
  log_info "Attempting to build frontend"
  if [ -d "client" ] && [ -f "client/package.json" ]; then
    log_info "Building frontend from source"
    (cd client && npm install && npm run build)
    BUILD_EXIT_CODE=$?
    
    if [ $BUILD_EXIT_CODE -ne 0 ]; then
      log_warning "Frontend build failed with exit code $BUILD_EXIT_CODE"
    else
      log_success "Frontend build completed successfully"
    fi
  else
    log_warning "Cannot build frontend: client directory or package.json not found"
  fi
  
  # Option 2: Create minimal required files if build failed or wasn't possible
  if [ ! -f "client/dist/index.html" ]; then
    log_warning "Creating minimal index.html"
    mkdir -p client/dist
    echo '<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>ShareThings Test Environment</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>ShareThings Test Environment</h1>
  <p>This is a minimal test page created for CI testing.</p>
</body>
</html>' > client/dist/index.html
    log_info "Created minimal index.html"
  fi
  
  # Create health endpoint
  mkdir -p client/dist/health
  echo '{"status":"ok"}' > client/dist/health/index.json
  log_info "Created health endpoint"
fi

# Check file permissions
log_info "Checking file permissions in client/dist"
if [ -d "client/dist" ]; then
  # List permissions
  ls -la client/dist
  
  # Ensure directory and files are accessible
  chmod -R 755 client/dist
  log_info "Set permissions on client/dist directory"
fi

# Verify static-server.js exists and is executable
log_info "Verifying static-server.js"
if [ ! -f "client/static-server.js" ]; then
  log_error "client/static-server.js not found"
  exit 1
else
  chmod 755 client/static-server.js
  log_info "Made static-server.js executable"
fi

# Log directory contents for debugging
log_info "Contents of client/dist directory:"
find client/dist -type f | sort
```

## Explanation of the Verification Process

1. **Directory Existence Check**: First, we check if the `client/dist` directory exists and create it if it doesn't.

2. **Essential Files Check**: We check for essential files like `index.html` and the `assets` directory that would typically be present in a built frontend project.

3. **Build Process**: If essential files are missing, we attempt to build the frontend from source. This is the preferred approach as it ensures all necessary files are created.

4. **Fallback Mechanism**: If the build fails or isn't possible, we create minimal versions of the required files to allow the container to start.

5. **Permission Check**: We ensure the directory and files have appropriate permissions (755) to be accessible by the container.

6. **Static Server Check**: We verify that the `static-server.js` file exists and is executable, as it's critical for the frontend container.

7. **Logging**: Throughout the process, we log detailed information to help diagnose any issues.

## Integration with GitHub Actions

To ensure this verification runs in the GitHub Actions environment, you can also add a specific step in the workflow file:

```yaml
- name: Verify client/dist directory
  run: |
    echo "Verifying client/dist directory..."
    if [ ! -d "client/dist" ]; then
      echo "Creating client/dist directory"
      mkdir -p client/dist
    fi
    
    if [ ! -f "client/dist/index.html" ]; then
      echo "Creating minimal index.html"
      echo '<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h1>Test Page</h1></body></html>' > client/dist/index.html
    fi
    
    mkdir -p client/dist/health
    echo '{"status":"ok"}' > client/dist/health/index.json
    
    chmod -R 755 client/dist
    echo "client/dist directory verified and prepared"
```

## Conclusion

This approach ensures that the `client/dist` directory exists and contains the necessary content before starting containers. By implementing these checks, we can prevent container crashes due to missing or inaccessible files in the GitHub Actions environment.

The verification process is designed to be non-intrusive - it only creates minimal files if they don't already exist, preserving any existing build artifacts. This ensures that the containers have what they need to start and run properly, while still using the proper build artifacts when available.
