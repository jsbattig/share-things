# ShareThings Docker Implementation Plan

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for dockerizing the ShareThings application. It summarizes the key decisions, outlines the steps to implement the solution, and references the detailed documentation.

## Executive Summary

We've designed a Docker-based architecture for ShareThings that:

1. Packages both client and server components in separate containers
2. Uses Nginx to serve the client's static files (built from the React application)
3. Configures HAProxy for SSL termination and WebSocket support
4. Provides a scalable and production-ready deployment solution

## Key Decisions

1. **Client Deployment Approach**: We've chosen to build the React application into static files and serve them with Nginx, rather than using the development server. This decision is based on performance, resource efficiency, and industry best practices. See [Client Server Options](./client-server-options.md) for a detailed comparison.

2. **Container Structure**: The application is split into two main containers:
   - Frontend container: Nginx serving the built React application
   - Backend container: Node.js running the Express and Socket.IO server

3. **HAProxy Integration**: HAProxy sits in front of the Docker containers, handling SSL termination and routing traffic to the appropriate container. See [HAProxy Docker Integration](./haproxy-docker-integration.md) for details.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Prepare Docker Configuration Files

1. Create the Docker configuration files:
   - `docker-compose.yml` in the root directory
   - `Dockerfile` in the server directory
   - `Dockerfile` and `nginx.conf` in the client directory

   Reference: [Docker Configuration Files](./docker-configuration-files.md)

2. Create environment configuration:
   - Backend environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`
   - Frontend environment variables in the client Dockerfile

### Phase 2: Build and Test Locally

1. Build the Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Verify the containers are running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

4. Test the application locally:
   - Access the frontend at http://localhost:8080
   - Test WebSocket functionality
   - Verify API endpoints

### Phase 3: Configure HAProxy

1. Install HAProxy on the host machine or a separate server:
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install haproxy
   
   # For CentOS/RHEL
   sudo yum install haproxy
   ```

2. Create the HAProxy configuration file:
   - Copy the configuration from [HAProxy Docker Integration](./haproxy-docker-integration.md)
   - Save it to `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`
   - Update with your specific domain and Docker host information

3. Set up SSL certificates:
   ```bash
   cat your_certificate.crt your_private_key.key > /etc/ssl/private/combined-cert.pem
   chmod 600 /etc/ssl/private/combined-cert.pem
   ```

4. Start HAProxy:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart haproxy
   ```

### Phase 4: Production Deployment

1. Update Docker Compose for production:
   - Set appropriate environment variables
   - Configure resource limits
   - Set up volume mounts if needed

2. Deploy to production:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

3. Verify the deployment:
   - Access the application via HAProxy (https://your-domain.com)
   - Test all functionality
   - Monitor logs and performance

## Scaling Strategy

For horizontal scaling:

1. Update Docker Compose to use the `deploy` section:
   ```yaml
   services:
     backend:
       # ... other configuration ...
       deploy:
         replicas: 3
   ```

2. Update HAProxy configuration to include all instances:
   ```
   backend sharethings_back
       # ... other configuration ...
       server backend1 docker-host:3001 check
       server backend2 docker-host:3002 check
       server backend3 docker-host:3003 check
   ```

3. Ensure sticky sessions for WebSocket connections:
   ```
   backend sharethings_back
       # ... other configuration ...
       stick-table type ip size 200k expire 30m
       stick on src
   ```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Set up HAProxy statistics:
   ```
   listen stats
       bind *:8404
       stats enable
       stats uri /stats
       stats refresh 10s
       stats auth admin:your-secure-password
   ```

2. Monitor container health:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   docker-compose logs
   ```

3. Set up log rotation:
   ```bash
   # For HAProxy
   sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/haproxy
   
   # For Docker
   sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
   ```

## Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues and solutions:

1. **WebSocket Connection Issues**:
   - Check HAProxy WebSocket configuration
   - Verify Nginx proxy settings for Socket.IO
   - Check timeouts in HAProxy configuration

2. **SSL Certificate Issues**:
   - Verify certificate file permissions and format
   - Check HAProxy SSL configuration
   - Test SSL configuration with online tools

3. **Container Connectivity Issues**:
   - Verify ports are exposed correctly
   - Check Docker network configuration
   - Test connectivity between containers

## Next Steps

1. Review the documentation and architecture
2. Implement the Docker configuration files
3. Test locally before deploying to production
4. Configure HAProxy for your specific environment
5. Deploy to production and monitor performance

By following this implementation plan, you'll have a robust, scalable, and production-ready Docker deployment for the ShareThings application.
