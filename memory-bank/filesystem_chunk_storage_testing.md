# FileSystemChunkStorage Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the work done to implement and test the `FileSystemChunkStorage` class, which is responsible for storing and managing chunks of data in the file system with metadata stored in a SQLite database.

## Work Done

### 1. Test Environment Setup
- Created mocks for Node.js core modules:
  - `crypto` - For generating unique content IDs
  - `fs/promises` - For file system operations
  - `path` - For path manipulations
  - `sqlite` - For database interactions

### 2. Mock Implementations

#### MockDatabaseManager
Created a mock implementation of the `DatabaseManager` class with the following features:
- Mocks database operations (exec, run, get, all)
- Implements transaction handling
- Tracks last insert ID and changes
- Provides a mock database instance

#### File System Mocks
- `mockFsPromises` - Mocks file system operations
- `mockPath` - Mocks path operations
- `mockCrypto` - Mocks crypto functions for deterministic testing

### 3. Test Coverage

#### Test File: `FileSystemChunkStorage.test.ts`
- Tests for basic chunk storage and retrieval
- Tests for content cleanup and expiration
- Tests for error handling and edge cases
- Tests for transaction handling

#### Key Test Cases:
1. **Basic Operations**
   - Saving and retrieving chunks
   - Updating chunk metadata
   - Deleting chunks

2. **Cleanup Functionality**
   - Automatic cleanup of old content
   - Cleanup by session ID
   - Error handling during cleanup

3. **Error Handling**
   - Database errors
   - File system errors
   - Invalid input handling

### 4. Current State

#### Working Features
- Basic chunk storage and retrieval
- Metadata management
- Transaction support
- Cleanup of old content

#### Known Issues
1. Some tests are failing due to:
   - Transaction handling in mocks
   - SQL query formatting differences
   - TypeScript type issues with mocks

2. Test coverage needs improvement for:
   - Edge cases
   - Error conditions
   - Performance with large numbers of chunks

### 5. Next Steps

#### Immediate Fixes
1. Fix transaction handling in mocks
2. Resolve SQL query formatting issues in tests
3. Fix TypeScript type errors

#### Future Improvements
1. Add more test cases for edge conditions
2. Implement performance testing
3. Add integration tests with real file system and database
4. Improve error messages and logging

## Dependencies
- Node.js v16+
- Jest for testing
- SQLite for metadata storage
- TypeScript for type checking

## Configuration
- Test configuration in `jest.config.js`
- TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json`
- Database schema in `src/infrastructure/storage/schema.sql`

## Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/__tests__/unit/FileSystemChunkStorage.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Debugging
To debug tests, add `--runInBand` to see more detailed output:
```bash
npm test -- --runInBand --verbose
```
