# Docker vs. Podman: Understanding the Differences

This document explains the key differences between Docker and Podman to help the team understand the migration.

## Architectural Differences

### Docker

- **Client-Server Architecture**: Docker uses a client-server architecture with a daemon (dockerd) that runs in the background.
- **Root Privileges**: The Docker daemon typically runs with root privileges, which can pose security risks.
- **Central Daemon**: All containers are managed by a single daemon process.

### Podman

- **Daemonless Architecture**: Podman doesn't require a daemon to run containers.
- **Rootless Containers**: Podman can run containers without root privileges, improving security.
- **Fork-Exec Model**: Each container runs as a child process of the Podman command.

## Command Compatibility

Podman is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Docker, with compatible CLI commands:

| Docker Command | Podman Equivalent |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `docker run` | `podman run` |
| `docker build` | `podman build` |
| `docker pull` | `podman pull` |
| `docker push` | `podman push` |
| `docker-compose` | `podman-compose` |

## Key Benefits of Podman

1. **Improved Security**:
   - Rootless containers
   - No daemon running with elevated privileges
   - Better isolation between containers

2. **Resource Management**:
   - No daemon consuming resources
   - Each container is a separate process
   - Better integration with systemd

3. **OCI Compliance**:
   - Fully compliant with OCI (Open Container Initiative) standards
   - Compatible with other OCI tools

4. **Pods**:
   - Native support for Kubernetes-style pods
   - Better for multi-container applications

## Limitations of Podman

1. **Docker Compose Compatibility**:
   - `podman-compose` is a separate project and may not have 100% compatibility
   - Some advanced Docker Compose features may not work the same way

2. **Ecosystem Integration**:
   - Some tools that expect Docker may need configuration changes
   - Docker-specific features may not be available

3. **Windows Support**:
   - Podman's Windows support is less mature than Docker's

## Using Podman in Our Project

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Build images
podman-compose -f podman-compose.yml build

# Start containers
podman-compose -f podman-compose.yml up -d

# Stop containers
podman-compose -f podman-compose.yml down

# View logs
podman logs <container-name>

# Execute commands in a container
podman exec -it <container-name> <command>
```

### Configuration Files

We've created the following Podman configuration files:

- `podman-compose.yml` - Development environment
- `podman-compose.prod.yml` - Production environment
- `podman-compose.test.yml` - Testing environment

### Migration Script

We've provided a `migrate-to-podman.sh` script to help with the migration process. This script:

1. Backs up Docker configuration files
2. Creates Podman configuration files
3. Rebuilds the application
4. Starts the containers with Podman

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**:
   - Ensure you're running Podman with the correct user
   - Check file permissions for volumes

2. **Network Issues**:
   - Podman uses different network namespaces
   - Check container networking configuration

3. **Volume Mounting**:
   - Ensure paths are correct for your system
   - Check SELinux settings if applicable
